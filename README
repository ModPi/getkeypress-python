Filename: getkeypress.c
Author: Joseph d'Eon
Description:
  This C module is meant to be made into a Python module of the same name.
  To build, run make. Making creates a .so file in this directory. As long
  as the .so file is in the directory, getkeypress can be imported into a 
  python program. 

  getkeypress hangs until a key is pressed by the keyboard(global keypress),
  then returns the key pressed in the form of a string. To test return values,
  simply try running the python script you have made and print the result
  of getkeypress in a while true loop. This will allow you to see the exact 
  string value for each key.
